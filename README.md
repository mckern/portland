# Portland, Oregon, USA
## AKA the Good One &mdash; sorry Maine

Hi! Hello! Welcome! Before we begin, the first thing we want you to understand is that **Voodoo Donuts is a tourist-trap** that sells tarted-up grocery store donuts and they aren't worth the line. We have much better [Donuts](#donut-shops).

With that out of the way, we're happy to have you here. Here's a list of stuff to do in town.

# Travel Tips

 * **BREAKING NEWS for 2018** Get yourself to [Multnomah Falls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multnomah_Falls) via the [GorgeExpress](http://columbiagorgeexpress.com). Parking out there is a pain anyway, so this simplifies it a lot.
 * Our local public transit system is called [TriMet](http://trimet.org), and their light rail service is called the MAX. You can use a mobile app to buy tickets for the train and bus, or you'll need [a Hop Card](https://www.myhopcard.com), which you can get at any [Fred Meyer](https://www.fredmeyer.com) or 7-11 in town
   - TriMet recently rolled out support for [paying with your cellphone](https://myhopcard.com/home/#/pay-with-your-phone). If you use GooglePay, Samsung Pay, or Apple Pay then there's no need to buy a ticket or install a separate app
   - Google Maps and Apple Maps both have a good understanding of our public transit infrastructure, and they can navigate you around town reasonably well
 * [Transit App](http://transitapp.com) is worth the money if you'll be using public transit frequently &mdash; it can helps with routes once you know where you're going
 * Cabs have to dispatched, you can't hail them. The exception is for taxi stands (Amtrak Station, Airport, in front of Hotels). [Radio Cab](http://www.radiocab.net) is a standby. Use [Curb](https://gocurb.com) to handle payments and dispatch from your phone.
 * We have Lyft and that other company also, if you insist
 * Those orange bikes you see around town are available on-demand through the [BikeTown program](https://www.biketownpdx.com). You'll have to register but the experience is supposed to be pretty painless overall (helmets are not provided). The program comes with caveats related to monthly fees and cancellation fees, and per their [User Agreement](https://www.biketownpdx.com/rental-agreement) - [email their legal team](mailto:legal@motivateco.com) with subject header "ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT" if you don't want to be bound to their arbitration rules. Also note that due to Biketown's relationship to the Nike company, the service is most commonly and incorrectly pronounced as "Bikey town".
 * There are Five Quadrants: Burnside divides North/South, Willamette and I-5 East/West. Our magical fifth quadrant is North Portland, which is North of the Willamette and West of I-5, but NE was already taken.
 * In parts of town, streets running East/West are in alphabetical order. North/South Streets are numbered. It's easy to get around.
 * This is [Bridge Town](http://www.bizave.com/portland/bridges/).

## Pronunciation Guide
* **Willamette** /wəˈlæmɪt/ "wuh-LA-mit", rhymes with 'dammit'
* **Couch**      /kutʃ/     "cooch"
* **Glisan**     /ˈglisən/  "GLEE-sin"
* **Going**      /gɔɪŋ/     "goyng", rhymes with 'boing'
* **Savior**     /ˈseɪvjəɹ/ "SAY-vyer", sounds like 'savior'

## FAQ

Our two free weekly papers got you covered: [Willamette Week](http://www.wweek.com) and [Portland Mercury](http://www.portlandmercury.com)

### What is up with the old buildings with numbers that aren't their number? I got lost in this place called Ladd's Addition?

Read up on the [Great Renumbering](http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/off-the-grid/Content?oid=8271672), and if you thought SemVer changes were a nightmare.

### There sure seems to be a lot of white people here&hellip;

Our state (and city) has a painful and lasting racist history that didn't involve any wars. You can read more [here](http://gizmodo.com/oregon-was-founded-as-a-racist-utopia-1539567040).

### Hey man, I hear you can, like, smoke weed here or something?

Of no surprise, our free newspapers got you covered [there also](http://www.wweek.com/2015/10/01/2365/)

Yup! Check out [Portland Cocktail Week](http://portlandcocktailweek.com) and while not definitive, this [cocktail map](http://pdx.eater.com/maps/best-portland-cocktail-bars) is a good starting point.

# Coffee Land

Portland was given the name [Coffee Land](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRtx33R4XhU) by the popular sketch-comedy show Portlandia and for good reason: Portland has a lot of great coffee.

# Brewvana

Portland's often called "Brewvana" due to the amazing number of craft breweries and cider-houses, beer bars, and general pub scene. Here's an opinionated (via @ahpook) selection of the best of the crop, with their Neighborhood in parenthesis:

## Breweries/Brewpubs

* [Cascade Barrel House](http://www.cascadebrewingbarrelhouse.com/): The "House of Sour", specialists in barrel-aged, fruited lambic and gueuze styles. Not to be missed. (Close-in SE)
* [Upright Brewing](http://www.uprightbrewing.com/): Mostly a Saison/Farmhouse specialist. (Close-in North Portland)
* [Ex Novo](http://www.exnovobrew.com/): A relatively new entrant to the PDX Brewing scene, but I like everything I've had from them, especially their "Eliot" IPA and "Wonder Twins" Rye IIPA. (Close-in North Portland)
* [Reverend Nat's](http://reverendnatshardcider.com/): Cider house. Innovative, challenging, occasionally undrinkable but always interesting (Close-in North Portland)
* [Ecliptic Brewing](http://eclipticbrewing.com/): Former Deschutes and Full Sail brewmaster, great mix of traditional and experimental styles, tasty pub fare and a very cool setting at the South end of hoppin' Mississippi Ave (North Portland)
* [Baerlic Brewing](http://baerlicbrewing.com/): Also relatively new, mostly English styles like Bitters, Cream Ales, and an amazing Stout. No food served. (Close-in SE)
* [Base Camp Brewing](http://basecampbrewingco.com/): If you ever wished that REI sold beer, Base Camp will feel like home. They're primarily lager specialists, which is unusual and welcome in the land of top-fermentation. (Central Eastside)
* [Natian Brewing](http://natianbrewery.com/): Unsure if they have a tasting room, call first (Central Eastside)
* [Breakside Brewing](http://www.breakside.com/): fantastic food and award-winning beer. *Mostly* lives up to the hype. (Dekum/North Portland)
* [10 Barrel Brewing](http://www.10barrel.com/): Sadly, now owned by a giant megacorp, but the beer is still pretty darn good. (The Pearl)
* [Von Ebert Brewing](http://vonebertbrewing.com/): Previously Ohio-based Fat Head brewing, but now an independent brewery. In the Pearl, just down from 10 Barrel and Deschutes so it's easy to bar-hop between them (see what I did there?)
* [Deschutes](http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/pubs/portland/): One of the originators of NW craft brewing. Still kills it with a variety of styles, especially their Porters and Stouts. (The Pearl)
* [Rogue Distillery and Public House](https://www.facebook.com/RoguePortland/events): Inexplicably popular; responsible for some of the least tasty "craft" beers I've ever had. Do not be tricked into buying the Voodoo Maple Bacon beer, it's disgusting.


## Beer/Cider Bars

Not breweries, but places to taste a wide variety of beer from near and far.

* [APEX](http://www.apexbar.com): Cash-only, bikes (motorized and non) encouraged, pinball. Arguably the best beer bar in Oregon, or maybe the United States. Does not sell tasters. (Close-in SE)
* [Bailey's](http://www.baileystaproom.com/): Solid tap list, mostly West Coast/Pacific NW focused. Gets crowded and loud, for a reason. Sells taster sizes. (Downtown)
* [Beer Mongers](http://thebeermongers.com/): Eight taps, hundreds of bottles and cans chilled and ready to drink. Friendly and relaxed staff. Kitty-corner from APEX. Sells taster sizes. (Close-in SE)
* [Belmont Station](http://www.belmont-station.com/): Beer nerd heaven. Very selective tap list and the attached bottle shop has the deepest selection in town. Sells taster sizes. (SE Stark/44th)
* [Bushwhacker's Cider](http://www.bushwhackercider.com/): Another option for Cider lovers, with a SE and a North Portland location.
* [Cider Bite](https://www.facebook.com/ciderbite): Newly-opened cider tasting bar. (MW Hoyt/13th)
* [Green Dragon](http://pdxgreendragon.com/): Owned by Rogue, but fortunately serves beers other than their house brands. 50 taps including a "secret" one. Does not sell taster sizes.
* [Growlers Guys](http://www.thegrowlerguys.com/our-locations/oregon-portland): Solid list of ~ 40 taps that cover west-coast favorites. Serves pints and taster sizes. (Close-in SE near Commons, Cascade Barrel House and the Green Dragon)
* [Hop Haven](https://www.facebook.com/Hop-Haven-Beer-Bar-and-Bottle-Shop-134805263237894/timeline/): Probably the closest "deep" craft beer bar to the Convention Center.
* [Loyal Legion](http://loyallegionpdx.com/): Busy and fun, 99 taps (not all of which are always lit up) and beer-boiled sausages. (Close-in SE)
* [Portland Cider House](http://portlandcider.com/): Cider specialists, for the fruit-inclined. (SE Hawthorne)
* [Saraveza](http://saraveza.com/): Wisconsin-worshiping "Cheers" vibe. Good bottle choices, small but well-curated tap list (North Portland)
* [Upper Lip](http://theupperlip.net/): Upstairs bar, above Bailey's Taproom. A few taps, and more than 170 bottles. (Downtown)

## Bagels

The Pacific Northwest has a contentious relationship with bagels: they're often just bread circles sold in super markets here, as many places do not boil them. If you'd like a real bagel, here's a handful of places we've found. [Willamette Week has a list](http://www.wweek.com/restaurants/2017/02/21/every-boiled-bagel-in-portland-ranked/) that was current as of 2017 but may be outdated now.

* [Henry Higgins Boiled Bagels](http://www.hhboiledbagels.com): the Everything Bagel has salt on it.
* [Kornblatt's Deli](http://kornblattsdelipdx.com): they will run out of bagels by early afternoon, so get there early if you want to get them to go.
