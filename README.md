#### Travel Tips

 * [TriMet](http://trimet.org) is your friend, the Max runs downtown. We have a mobile app to buy bus passes with.
 * [Transit App](http://transitapp.com) is worth the money, helps with routes once you know where are going
  - If you are planning to take the bus, this is a good [beginners guide](http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/youre-riding-the-bus-wrong/Content?oid=16545882)
 * Cabs have to dispatched, you can't hail them. [Radio Cab](http://www.radiocab.net) is a standby. Use [Curb](https://gocurb.com) to handle payments and dispatch from your phone.
 * We have Lyft and that other company also
 * There are Five Quadrants: Burnside divides North/South, Willamette and I-5 East/West. Our magical fifth quadrant is North Portland, which is North of the Willamete and East of I-5, but NE was already taken.
 * Couch is pronounced "cooch"
