### Portland, Oregon, USA (aka the Good One - sorry Maine)

The first thing you have to understand: Voodoo Donuts is **bullshit**, [Blue Star](http://www.bluestardonuts.com) and [Pips](https://www.facebook.com/PipsOriginal) are amazing.

#### Travel Tips

 * [TriMet](http://trimet.org) is your friend, the Max runs downtown. We have a mobile app to buy bus passes with.
 * [Transit App](http://transitapp.com) is worth the money, helps with routes once you know where are going
  - If you are planning to take the bus, this is a good [beginners guide](http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/youre-riding-the-bus-wrong/Content?oid=16545882)
 * Cabs have to dispatched, you can't hail them. The exception is for taxi stands (Amtrak Station, Airport, in front of Hotels). [Radio Cab](http://www.radiocab.net) is a standby. Use [Curb](https://gocurb.com) to handle payments and dispatch from your phone.
 * We have Lyft and that other company also
 * There are Five Quadrants: Burnside divides North/South, Willamette and I-5 East/West. Our magical fifth quadrant is North Portland, which is North of the Willamete and West of I-5, but NE was already taken.
 * Couch is pronounced "cooch" and Oregon is "orygun"
 * In parts of town, streets running East/West are in alphabetical order. North/South Streets are numbered. It's easy to get around.
 * This is [Bridge Town](http://www.bizave.com/portland/bridges/).

#### FAQ
 * "Where can I find out about shows/events/things to do"
  - Our two free weekly papers got you covered: [Willamette Week](http://www.wweek.com) and [Portland Mercury](http://www.portlandmercury.com)
 * "What is up with the old builings with numbers that aren't their number? I got lost in this place called Ladd's Addition?"
  - Read up on the [Great Renumbering](http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/off-the-grid/Content?oid=8271672), and if you thought SemVar changes were a nightmare.

 * "There sure seems to be a lot of white people here"
  - Our state (and city) has a painful and lasting racist history that didn't involve any wars. You can read more [here](http://gizmodo.com/oregon-was-founded-as-a-racist-utopia-1539567040).
 * "Hey man, I hear you can, like, smoke weed here or something?"
  - Of no surprise, our free newspapers got you covered [there also](http://www.wweek.com/2015/10/01/2365/)

#### Brewvana:

Portland's often called "Brewvana" due to the amazing number of craft breweries and cider-houses, beer bars, and general pub scene. Here's an opinionated (via @ahpook) selection of the best of the crop, with their Neighborhood in parenthesis:

##### Breweries/Brewpubs

* [Cascade Barrel House](http://www.cascadebrewingbarrelhouse.com/) - The "House of Sour", specialists in barrel-aged, fruited lambic and gueuze styles. Not to be missed. (Close-in SE)
* [Commons Brewing](http://www.commonsbrewery.com/) - Focused on Saison/Farmhouse ales and other rustic styles. No food to speak of, but great taster trays and extremely high-quality beer. (Close-in SE)
* [Upright Brewing](http://www.uprightbrewing.com/) - Also mostly a Saison/Farmhouse specialist but with a "wilder" edge than Commons. (Close-in North Portland)
* [Ex Novo](http://www.exnovobrew.com/) - A relatively new entrant to the PDX Brewing scene, but I like everything I've 
* had from them, especially their "Eliot" IPA and "Wonder Twins" Rye IIPA. (Close-in North Portland)
* [Reverend Nat's](http://reverendnatshardcider.com/) - Cider house. Innovative, challenging, occasionally undrinkable but always interesting (Close-in North Portland)
* [Ecliptic Brewing](http://eclipticbrewing.com/) - Former Deschutes brewmaster, great mix of traditional and experimental styles, tasty pub fare and a very cool setting at the South end of hoppin' Mississippi Ave (North Portland)
* [Baerlic Brewing](http://baerlicbrewing.com/) - Also relatively new, mostly English styles like Bitters, Cream Ales, and an amazing Stout. No food served. (Close-in SE)
* [Burnside Brewing](http://www.burnsidebrewco.com/) - Closest brewery to the Convention center, with decent lunch and solid brews. (Central Eastside)
* [Base Camp Brewing](http://basecampbrewingco.com/) - If you ever wished that REI sold beer, Base Camp will feel like home. They're primarily lager specialists, which is unusual and welcome in the land of top-fermentation. (Central Eastside)
* [Natian Brewing](http://natianbrewery.com/) - Unsure if they have a tasting room, call first (Central Eastside)
* [Breakside Brewing](http://www.breakside.com/) - fantastic food and award-winning beer. *Mostly* lives up to the hype. (Dekum/North Portland)
* [10 Barrel Brewing](http://www.10barrel.com/) - Sadly, now owned by a giant megacorp, but the beer is still pretty darn good. (The Pearl)
* [Fat Head's Brewing](http://fatheadsportland.com/) - Obnoxious label art but solid, hop-heavy brews. First Oregon location of this Ohio-based brewery is in the Pearl, just down from 10 Barrel, Bridgeport, and Deschutes so it's easy to bar-hop between them (see what I did there?)
* [Deschutes](http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/pubs/portland/) - One of the originators of NW craft brewing. Still kills it with a variety of styles, especially their Porters and Stouts. (The Pearl)
* [Bridgeport Brewing](http://www.bridgeportbrew.com/) - Credited with creating the first American IPA. Excellent food and a bustling brewpub atmosphere - a block from the previous Puppetlabs (currently Simple) office. (The Pearl)
* [Rogue Distillery and Public House](https://www.facebook.com/RoguePortland/events) - Inexplicably popular; responsible for some of the least tasty "craft" beers I've ever had. Do not be tricked into buying the Voodoo Maple Bacon beer, it's disgusting.

##### Beer/Cider Bars

Not breweries, but places to taste a wide variety of beer from near and far.

* [APEX](http://www.apexbar.com) - Cash-only, bikes (motorized and non) encouraged, pinball. Arguably the best beer bar in Oregon, or maybe the United States. (Close-in SE)
* [Bailey's](http://www.baileystaproom.com/) - Solid tap list, mostly West Coast/Pacific NW focused. Gets crowded and loud, for a reason. (Downtown)
* [Belmont Station](http://www.belmont-station.com/) - Beer nerd heaven. Very selective tap list and the attached bottle shop has the deepest selection in town. (SE Stark/44th)
* [Loyal Legion](http://loyallegionpdx.com/) - Busy and fun, 99 taps (not all of which are always lit up) and beer-boiled sausages. (Close-in SE)
* [Hop Haven](https://www.facebook.com/Hop-Haven-Beer-Bar-and-Bottle-Shop-134805263237894/timeline/) - Probably the closest "deep" craft beer bar to the Convention Center.
* [Saraveza](http://saraveza.com/) - Wisconsin-worshipping "Cheers" vibe. Good bottle choices, small but well-curated tap list (North Portland)
* [Green Dragon](http://pdxgreendragon.com/) - Owned by Rogue, but fortunately serves beers other than their house brands. 50 taps including a "secret" one.
* [Portland Cider House](http://portlandcider.com/) - Cider specialists, for the fruit-inclined. (SE Hawthorne)
* [Bushwhacker's Cider](http://www.bushwhackercider.com/) - Another option for Cider lovers, with a SE and a North Portland location.
