### Portland, Oregon, USA (aka the Good One - sorry Maine)

![Portland front](http://blog.newrelic.com/wp-content/uploads/portland_stag.png)

The first thing you have to understand: Voodoo Donuts is bullshit, [Blue Star](http://www.bluestardonuts.com) and [Pips](https://www.facebook.com/PipsOriginal) are amazing.

#### Travel Tips

 * [TriMet](http://trimet.org) is your friend, the Max runs downtown. We have a mobile app to buy bus passes with.
 * [Transit App](http://transitapp.com) is worth the money, helps with routes once you know where are going
  - If you are planning to take the bus, this is a good [beginners guide](http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/youre-riding-the-bus-wrong/Content?oid=16545882)
 * Cabs have to dispatched, you can't hail them. [Radio Cab](http://www.radiocab.net) is a standby. Use [Curb](https://gocurb.com) to handle payments and dispatch from your phone.
 * We have Lyft and that other company also
 * There are Five Quadrants: Burnside divides North/South, Willamette and I-5 East/West. Our magical fifth quadrant is North Portland, which is North of the Willamete and East of I-5, but NE was already taken.
 * In parts of town, streets running East/West are in alphabetical order. North/South Streets are numbered. It's easy to get around.
 * Couch is pronounced "cooch"
 * This is [Bridge Town](http://www.bizave.com/portland/bridges/).

#### FAQ

  - Read up on the [Great Renumbering](http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/off-the-grid/Content?oid=8271672), and if you thought SemVar changes were a nightmare.
 * "There sure seems to be a lot of white people here"
  - Our state (and city) has a painful and lasting racist history that didn't involve any wars. You can read more [here](http://gizmodo.com/oregon-was-founded-as-a-racist-utopia-1539567040).
 * "Hey man, I hear you can, like, smoke weed here or something?"
  - Of no surprise, our free newspapers got you covered [there also](http://www.wweek.com/2015/10/01/2365/)
